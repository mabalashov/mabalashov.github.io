However, if you look carefully, you should add browser bookmarks here. Many of us just save them in the browser. They accumulate there and eventually remain without attention.</p>\n<p>There are several standard solutions for adding a card to Trello:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trello application for the desktop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/media/trello-gtd/01.png\" alt=\"Trello desktop\" title=\"Trello desktop\"></p>\n<p>However, this is not very suitable for saving bookmarks, because you cannot add a screenshot. The link fits into the description, not as an attachment. So the name of the bookmark will have to be typed manually.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trello chrome extensions. It has many solutions, varying degrees of readiness and stability. In any case, you cannot upload a screenshot or you have got a lot of manual work.</li>\n<li>Manually create a card on Trello.com. It is suitable for people who have a lot of free time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upon the whole, not finding a suitable solution — I wrote my own plugin. Meet <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trello-bookmark/ephoopolmejjnjkbbdcfgoohokhnekca\">Trello Bookmark</a>!</p>\n<p>Here’s what it has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>board and list selection (personal and team);</li>\n<li>position in the list;</li>\n<li>name of the card;</li>\n<li>description;</li>\n<li>link (as an attachment);</li>\n<li>cover;</li>\n<li>labels;</li>\n<li>due date;</li>\n<li>assignee;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And additionally to above-stated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it supports hotkeys (keyboard navigation through tab and arrows, saving by CTRL + enter);</li>\n<li>advanced logic field by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/media/trello-gtd/02.png\" alt=\"Trello Bookmark default locations\" title=\"Trello Bookmark default locations\"></p>\n<p>You can link the site you often visit a specific path for the card and the plugin will offer it by default. This means that you relieved to enter the address every time. You can also give a special path for a new browser tab. Then the plugin will open with empty fields (convenient for saving quick tasks to inbox):</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/trello-gtd/03.png\" alt=\"Google Chrome new tab with Trello Bookmark\" title=\"Google Chrome new tab with Trello Bookmark\"></p>\n<p>If the plugin is opened on a site that is not added in the settings, the last used path is suggested. All these features may seem overkill, but if you add tens or hundreds of cards a day, they save you a lot of time.</p>\n<p>Here’s what one of the boards with my girlfriend looks like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/trello-gtd/04.png\" alt=\"Trello cooking board\" title=\"Trello cooking board\"></p>\n<p>You may have noticed that my new chrome tab looks unusual.</p>\n<p>I was always annoyed that I couldn’t get a summary of tasks from different boards and teams in Trello and make a list for the day. And this is very important, especially if you follow the M. I. T. technique.</p>\n<p>As a result, thanks to the Open Trello API, I made another plugin that pulls out cards according to a certain criterion:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/trello-gtd/05.png\" alt=\"Trello Picker\" title=\"Trello Picker\"></p>\n<p>At the moment, this criterion is the presence of a red label “!!!”. In the future, I will add the ability to put down your criteria: for example, tasks with a deadline for today.</p>\n<p>While the plugin is not available for public use, write in the comments or me on marat.dospolov@gmail.com if you want to get it faster.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Trello is an amazing tool that can solve most of your tasks, especially if you apply a little magic!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/media/trello-gtd/06.png\" alt=\"“One ring to rule them all.”\" title=\"“One ring to rule them all.”\"></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/trello-plus-gtd-equals-trello-bookmark","tagSlugs":["/tag/trello","/tag/gtd","/tag/chrome","/tag/plugin"],"categorySlug":"/category/productivity"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-03-27T00:46:37.121Z","description":"You know, I hate routine.\nBut one of the greatest things about being a programmer is that you can automate your routine.","category":"productivity","tags":["trello","gtd","chrome","plugin"],"title":"Trello + GTD = Trello Bookmark"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/trello-plus-gtd-equals-trello-bookmark","allCategories":[{"fieldValue":"productivity","totalCount":1,"categoryColor":"pink-600"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2052939023","251939775","401334301"]}
